# STIG: RHEL-07-021240 - A separate file system must be used for user home directories (such as /home or an equivalent).
# description: The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing.
# severity: 'low'
# checkid: 'C-RHEL-07-021240_chk'
# fixid: 'F-RHEL-07-021240_fix'
# version: 'RHEL-07-021240'
# ruleid: 'RHEL-07-021240_rule'
# fixtext: 'Migrate the /home directory onto a separate file system/partition.'
# checktext: 'Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for non-privileged local interactive user home directories.
#
#Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users (those with a UID greater than 1000) on the system with the following command:
#
##cut -d: -f 1,3,6,7 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{3}" | tr ":" "\t"
#
#adamsj /home/adamsj /bin/bash
#jacksonm /home/jacksonm /bin/bash
#smithj /home/smithj /bin/bash
#
#The output of the command will give the directory/partition that contains the home directories for the non-privileged users on the system (in this example, /home) and usersâ€™ shell. All accounts with a valid shell (such as /bin/bash) are considered interactive users.
#
#Check that a file system/partition has been created for the non-privileged interactive users with the following command:
#
#Note: The partition of /home is used in the example.
#
## grep /home /etc/fstab
#UUID=333ada18    /home                   ext4    noatime,nobarrier,nodev  1 2
#
#If a separate entry for the file system/partition that contains the non-privileged interactive users\' home directories does not exist, or the file system/partition for the non-privileged interactive users is not /home, this is a finding.'
