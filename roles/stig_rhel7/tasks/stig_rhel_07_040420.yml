# STIG: RHEL-07-040420 - The system must not allow interfaces to perform Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirects by default.
# description: ICMP redirect messages are used by routers to inform hosts that a more direct route exists for a particular destination. These messages contain information from the system\'s route table, possibly revealing portions of the network topology.
