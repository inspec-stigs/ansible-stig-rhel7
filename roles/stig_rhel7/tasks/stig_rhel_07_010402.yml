# description: If cached authentication information is out of date, the validity of the authentication information may be questionable.

#If “ssh” is in use on the system, set the “ssh_known_hosts_timeout” value to “86400” or less in /etc/sssd/sssd.conf:

#Check to see if the “sssd” service is active with the following command:
#
## systemctl status sssd.service

#If the service is active, the command will return:
#
#sssd.service - System Security Services Daemon
#   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/sssd.service; enabled)
#   Active: active (running) since Thu 2014-09-25 10:46:43 CEST; 5s ago
#
#If the service is not active, this is a finding.
#
#Check the services option for the active services of each domain configured with the following command:
#
## grep services /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
#
#The command will return one line for each domain. In the example:
#
#services = nss, pam
#services = nss, pam
#
#There are two services lines as the “nss” and “pam” services are being used by two domains (ldap and local).
#
#If “pam” is an active service, check the “offline_credentials_expiration” option with the following command:
#
## grep -i offline_credentials_expiration /etc/sssd/sssd.conf 
#offline_credentials_expiration = 1
#
#If “offline_credentials_expiration” is set to a value greater than “1”, is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.'
