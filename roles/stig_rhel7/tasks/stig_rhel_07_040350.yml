# STIG: RHEL-07-040350 - The system must not forward Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) source-routed packets.
# description: Source-routed packets allow the source of the packet to suggest that routers forward the packet along a different path than configured on the router, which can be used to bypass network security measures. This requirement applies only to the forwarding of source-routed traffic, such as when IPv4 forwarding is enabled and the system is functioning as a router.
