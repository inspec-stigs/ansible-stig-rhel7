# STIG: RHEL-07-030710 - The operating system must generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events.
# description: Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.  Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).  Satisfies: SRG-OS-000004-GPOS-00004, SRG-OS-000239-GPOS-00089, SRG-OS-000241-GPOS-00090, SRG-OS-000241-GPOS-00091, SRG-OS-000303-GPOS-00120, SRG-OS-000476-GPOS-00221
