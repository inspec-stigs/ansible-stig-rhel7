# STIG: RHEL-07-030526 - All uses of the sudoedit command must be audited.
# description: Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information.  At a minimum, the organization must audit the full-text recording of privileged access commands. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.
